# Alpha Version 1.0 #

The purpose of this release is to establish a baseline from which all further work on the engine would build upon. With that in mind, the features in this release will be very narrow and will not be anything noteworthy that differentiates the engine from other available software. However, the goal is to provide a uniform interaction of all engine modules such that future releases are hopefully not drastically different. This is not a guarantee as the engine's development is long term and may encompass many reworks, it is a design goal of this release only and will be respected as such.
